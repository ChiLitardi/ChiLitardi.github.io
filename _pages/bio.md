Hello! I am a Research Officer at Eurofound and a PhD student at University College Dublin School of Economics supervised by Benjamin Elsner. My research is in applied economics, with a strong focus on migration and how migration affects the lives of migrants and natives.

Previously I worked at the European Central Bank.

I received both my Bachelors and Masters degrees in Economics and Finance from LUISS.
