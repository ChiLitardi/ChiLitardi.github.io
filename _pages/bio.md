Hello! I am a Research Officer at Eurofound and a PhD student at University College Dublin School of Economics supervised by Benjamin Elsner. The research I plan to do for the PhD will be in labor economics, with a strong focus on migration and how migration affects the lives of migrants and natives. I currently work and have worked on topics related to company restructuring, employment and on social upward convergence. 

I was previously research support officer responsible for data management, quality control and analysis of the European Restructuring Monitor databases. Prior to joining Eurofound in 2021, I worked as an analyst at the European Central Bank, running pan-euro area surveys and doing research on payment behaviour and financial inclusion. 

I hold a Master's degree in Economics and Finance from LUISS University in Rome and a double degree in Quantitative Techniques for Economics and Management (QTEM).
